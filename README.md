# Pinecone Vector Database Project
---

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for using Pinecone, a vector database, for managing and querying vector embeddings. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following packages installed:
- `pinecone-client`
- `google.colab` (for running the notebook in Google Colab)
- `python-dotenv` (if using environment variables)

Install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pinecone-client python-dotenv
```

### Project Structure

- `Pinecone_DB_(_Vector_Database_).ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook that contains the code for interacting with the Pinecone vector database.
- `.env`: File to store environment variables, including your Pinecone API key.

### Setting Up

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Pinecone_Vector_Database.git
    cd Pinecone_Vector_Database
    ```

2. **Add your Pinecone API key**:
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add your API key:
    ```plaintext
    PINECONE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

3. **Upload the `.env` file to Google Colab** (if using Google Colab) and mount Google Drive:
    ```python
    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount('/content/drive')
    ```

4. **Run the Jupyter notebook**:
    Open and run the cells in `Pinecone_DB_(_Vector_Database_).ipynb` to interact with the Pinecone vector database.

### Usage

1. **Initialization**:
    Load your API key and initialize the Pinecone client.
    ```python
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    import os

    load_dotenv()
    api_key = os.getenv('PINECONE_API_KEY')

    from pinecone import Pinecone, ServerlessSpec

    pc = Pinecone(api_key=api_key)
    spec = ServerlessSpec(cloud="aws", region="us-east-1")
    ```

2. **Insert Vectors**:
    Add your vector embeddings to the Pinecone index.
    ```python
    # Example code to insert vectors
    vectors = [...]  # Your vector data here
    pc.upsert(vectors)
    ```

3. **Query Vectors**:
    Perform similarity searches on your vector embeddings.
    ```python
    # Example code to query vectors
    query_vector = [...]  # Your query vector here
    response = pc.query(query_vector)
    print(response)
    ```
